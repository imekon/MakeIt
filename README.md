# MakeIt

Let's make another game engine!

Oh no! Not another one!

I'm basing this one on:

* SFML
* ImGui
* Box2D
* LUA
* LuaBridge (excellent tool to expose C++ classes in Lua)

Why build yet another game engine?

Because... that's how you learn how they work!

I've done this before, with:

* SFML
* DukTape (JavaScript interpreter in C)
* Box2D

I'm starting again because everything has moved on, and WHY NOT!?!
